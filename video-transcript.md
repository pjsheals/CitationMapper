AI assistants like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude are rapidly becoming the first place people go for 
answers, product research, and recommendations.

But hereâ€™s the challenge: if your brand isnâ€™t mentioned in those AI-generated answers, youâ€™re 
effectively invisible in the new discovery funnel.

Traditional SEO doesnâ€™t explain visibility inside AI assistants.  
Backlinks and rankings donâ€™t determine whether you appear.

Instead, AI assistants generate answers based on structured citations, trusted datasets, and 
prompt relevance.  
And thereâ€™s no easy way to measure or track this.

Thatâ€™s why we created **CitationMapperâ„¢**.

CitationMapperâ„¢ is an experimental tool designed to test prompts across AI assistants, extract the 
entities they mention, and map which citation platforms support those results.

We also take the next step â€” using unique UTM links and Google Analytics 4 to see whether 
being mentioned in ChatGPT or Gemini actually drives real traffic to your website.

For the first time, you can connect AI visibility to measurable site visits.

CitationMapperâ„¢ is part of the **AIVO Standardâ„¢ â€“ AIVO Mesh Lab**.

Weâ€™re running early experiments right now, and you can explore the tool yourself at
